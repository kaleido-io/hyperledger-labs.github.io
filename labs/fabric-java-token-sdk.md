# Lab Name
[Fabric Token Java SDK.](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/Fabric-Token-Java-SDK)

# Short Description
This project has the objective to create and provide a java interface to the project [Fabric Token SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk)

# Scope of Lab
Hyperledger Fabric is a complete and multi-language environment. One of its parts is the chaincode. It can be developed in Java, Node and Golang, but not all developers have the ability to develop on all 3 languages.
As such, is the mission of this project to create and provide a Java solution to interact with the go chaincode that was created in [Fabric Token SDK](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-token-sdk).
This will be created using a JNI to interact with the services that the Token SDK provides.
