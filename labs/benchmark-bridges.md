# Lab Name
[Benchmarking Cross-Chain Bridges](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/benchmarking-cross-chain-bridges)

# Short Description
Systematic comparison between cross-chain bridge aggregators.

This lab has been proposed to provide a repository for the following project (code might be incorporated into Hyperledger Cacti in the future): https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Project+Plan+-+Benchmarking+Cross-Chain+Bridges

# Scope of Lab
The goal of this project is to benchmark cross-chain solutions, an essential step for measuring the performance of any solution. As the adoption of cross-chain bridges grows it is increasingly important to have benchmarks to measure cross-chain solutions' performance and security.
