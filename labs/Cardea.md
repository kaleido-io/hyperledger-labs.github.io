# Short Description
Cardea is a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, currently open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH).

# Scope of Lab
Cardea builds on Hyperledger Aries, Hyperledger Indy, and Hyperledger Ursa to provide an ecosystem for privacy-preserving digital credentials, focused on the intersection of healthcare data and verifiable credentials. Cardea includes a package of agents to facilitate issuance, holding and verification of credentials pertinent to healthcare data. Cardea has hosted several interop-a-thons to facilitate interoperability testing between the Cardea community, as well as the broader Aries community.
