# Lab Name
[Fabric Channeled Add-ons Gen](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen)

# Short Description
**fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** is an open-source generator for Hyperledger Fabric add-on apps in dedicated channels.
Inspired by the increasing utilization of browser extensions, **fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** provides a solution
for deploying user-managed applications on different Hyperledger Fabric channels in the UX form of add-ons.

# Scope of Lab
State-of-the-art blockchains use simple user interfaces for wallet functionalities as browser extensions. In this context, 
**fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** provides the sufficient environment for easily deploying new applications in the form of browser 
add-ons on different Hyperledger Fabric channels along with user management backing. The following attributes pertain to the 
utility of the generator:

- User management: **fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** offers user management governance by generating dedicated accounts per 
organization per deployed channel. Fabric admins employ the user management feature to govern the credential 
sharing for end-users per add-on app generated.


- Add-on: **fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** is provided in the context of generating browser add-on apps with business intelligence on dedicated 
Hyperledger Fabric channels. Backing browser interoperability for Fabric networks facilitates end-user interaction and
experience.


- Privacy: **fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** supports automatic deployment of apps in dedicated Hyperledger
Fabric channels. Managing private ledger data and its flows is enabled as each add-on app is deployed for a separate channel.
Also, bulk deployment of add-on applications is facilitated by the generator.


**fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** eases the process of managing end-users of Hyperledger Fabric dApps organizing them in dedicated channels. 
The adopters of the generator are able to deploy with ease their new app in a separate channel with end-user credentials configured.
Contributors on **fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** can bring their own business intelligence or browser support, 
and extend the generator beyond the initial release that consists of the **asset-transfer-basic** workflow.

**fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** provides flexible configuration and deployment of add-on applications in separate Fabric channels
by automating:

- User management
- Deployment as browser add-on
- Data privacy through channels

**fabric-channeled-add-ons-gen** is an open-source generator, suitable for Hyperledger Fabric networks, where the applications are
deployed as add-ons for a separate channel with easy user management in mind.
