# Short Description
The CC-Tools package provides a relational-like framework for programming Hyperledger Fabric chaincodes.

# Scope of Lab
The CC-Tools project aims to provide an easy to use framework to develop Hyperledger Fabric chaincodes in Golang.

CC-Tools provides a relational-like definitions of asset types, datatype validation, also allowing the creation of custom types, Fabric events management and easy transaction definition, with built-in arguments validation and callers restriction. Some pre-defined transactions includes standard method to create, delete, update and read assets.

The CC-Tools-Demo repository provides a template for CC-Tools, featuring configurations and examples of asset types, transactions and events usage. It also features scripts to easily start or upgrade a network and a rest server API written using GIN, which provides access to endpoints to communicate with the chaincode (with routes using `fabric-sdk-go` and `fabric-gateway`) and automatic subscription to CC-Tools events.
