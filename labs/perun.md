# Short Description

Blockchain-agnostic State Channels framework.

# Scope of Lab



The Perun framework is a suite of implementations around the [Perun state
channel protocols](https://perun.network/) ([introduction
paper](https://perun.network/wp-content/uploads/Perun2.0.pdf)). The Perun protocols provide
payment and general state channel functionality to all existing blockchains
that feature smart contracts. As a blockchain scalability solution, payment
and state channels reduce transaction costs and increase the system throughput
by executing incremental transactions off-chain. The Perun protocols have been
proven cryptographically secure in the UC-framework. They are
blockchain-agnostic and only rely on a blockchain's capability to execute
smart contracts.

Currently the project consists of three main parts:

- _go-perun_ is a Go SDK that implements the core state channel protocol in a
  blockchain-agnostic fashion by following the dependency inversion principle.
  For this reason, several blockchain backends can be chosen and only
  blockchain-specific initializations need to be executed at program startup.

- _perun-eth-contracts_ contains the interconnected smart contracts for the
  Ethereum backend. They define the on-chain logic for channel deposits,
  disputes, settlements and withdrawals.

- _perun-node_ is a state channel node. It builds upon the go-perun SDK for
  establishing and operating Perun state channels, sets up a network
  for off-chain communications and provides an API interface for the user to
  interact with. To start with, Ethereum payment channels are implemented.
