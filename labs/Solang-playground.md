# Lab Name
Solang Playground

# Short Description
Solang playground is a web IDE for [Hyperledger Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang). It is an easy way for Solidity developers to write, compile, deploy and interact with a Solidity contract deployed on Solana or Polkadot, without prior installation of any of the required tools (including Solang).

# Scope of Lab

Solang playground is a supporting project for [Hyperledger Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang). If a comparison is made to the Ethereum ecosystem, Hyperledger Solang would be compared to [Solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity), while Solang playground would be compared to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
