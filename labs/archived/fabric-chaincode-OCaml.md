# Lab Name
[fabric-chaincode-OCaml](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-chaincode-ocaml)

# Short Description
Hyperledger Fabric Packages for OCaml Chaincode

# Scope of Lab
This lab aims at developping an API to write Hyperledger Fabric chaincodes in [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/).
Such an API would enable the writing of formally proven chaincodes.
Indeed, OCaml is a ML-based language prone to safe programming, and many formal proof tools are instrumented to generate OCaml code (Coq, Why3...).
