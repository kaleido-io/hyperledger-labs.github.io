# Lab Name
[karma-charity-platform](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/karma-charity-platform)

# Short Description
Blockchain-based charity foundation platform.

# Scope of Lab
The Karma â€“ is a blockchain-based charity foundation platform implemented on the top of Hyperledger Fabric. 
The Karma platform allows charitable organizations and funds to create and manage different philanthropic projects, 
accept donations, and present the auditable public trail of all transactions and other activities.

Currently, most blockchain projects in NPOs are implemented on the permissionless blockchain, which has limited control
over the validators responsible for the authenticity of transactions. The Karma project demonstrates the novel approach
that implements permissioned blockchain technology on the public charity platform.
