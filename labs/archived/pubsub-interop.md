# Lab Name
[PubSub Interop](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/pubsub-interop)

# Short Description
A blockchain interoperability solution for permissioned blockchain networks based on a publish/subscribe pattern.

# Scope of Lab
The use of blockchains in different industries has increased dramatically in the past few years. This increase has resulted in many blockchains being created which are working in isolation from each other. In order to enable the full potential of blockchain networks, interoperability solutions are needed for transferring or sharing data across these networks. The goal of this project is to propose a solution for blockchain interoperability in permissioned blockchain networks based on a publish/subscribe pattern. In this solution, a blockchain acts as a messaging broker and keeps track of all the topics in the system. Publisher blockchains can send messages to the topics and all the subscriber blockchains will get notified of the changes in the topic as soon as a publish request is received.

More information on the project, a detailed project plan, and the progress report of the project can be found on [the project's page in Hyperledger Wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/INTERN/Towards+Blockchain+Interoperability+with+Hyperledger).
