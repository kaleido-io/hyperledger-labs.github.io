# Lab Name
[dancap](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/dancap)

# Short Description
A lab for exploring trusted execution attestation API and deployment options for Hyperledger Avalon.

# Scope of Lab
This lab faciltates exploration of attestation options for Hyperledger Avalon and projects with
similar requirements in Hyperledger such as Fabric Private Chaincode and the PDO lab.
The lab aspires to two main goals and several related goals. There are several API / SDK options
available to TEE projects. We want to find the best fit for Avalon. Second these APIs have
infrastructure dependencies that may vary across deployment scenaries. This lab aims to find the
the most portable deployment patterns.

The less formal goals for the lab include creating clear examples of the APIs and possibly some
utilities to facilitate testing for the availability of features in a hosted environment and or
utilities for ease of deployment into various environments.
