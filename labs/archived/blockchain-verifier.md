# Lab Name
[Blockchain Verifier](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/blockchain-verifier)

# Short Description
A tool to check and verify the integrity of ledgers and the correctness of smart contracts

# Scope of Lab
The goal of Blockchain Verifier is to provide a tool that help auditing the blockchain-based systems.
Audits will require checks on the systems and their data to ensure that the systems are running properly.

This tool performs basic verification on the blocks and transactions stored in the blockchain nodes, for example, Hyperledger Fabric peers, and also allows users to perform their own application-level checks on the transactions and states.
Its goal is to provide evidences for data integrity in blockchain-based systems to get ready for auditing,
and to provide framework to perform post-checks for the transactions and states.
