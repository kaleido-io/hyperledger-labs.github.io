# Lab Name
Nephos

# Short Description
Python library and Helm charts for deployment of Hyperledger Fabric to Kubernetes.

# Scope of Lab
Deploying Fabric to Kubernetes is quite laborious and fraught with potential issues. Nephos provides helper functionality and end to end deployment capabilities for (initially) test and QA/POC deployments and (eventually) fully fledged production environments.
