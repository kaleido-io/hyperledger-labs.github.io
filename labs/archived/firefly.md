# Lab Name
[FireFly](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/firefly)

# Short Description
FireFly is a multiparty system for enterprise data flows, powered by blockchain.

# Scope of Lab
FireFly is designed to make building blockchain apps quick and easy, by allowing developers to focus on business logic, instead of infrastructure and cryptography. Enterprise use cases often require a mix of off-chain and on-chain activities to implement a use case end-to-end. FireFly provides a set of pre-integrated runtimes and an API to build event-driven, multi-party applications with a combination of off-chain data flows and on-chain transactions.

FireFly is designed to be completely modular, allowing components at each layer to be swapped out for a different implementation, including the messaging system, the database, and even the blockchain itself.
