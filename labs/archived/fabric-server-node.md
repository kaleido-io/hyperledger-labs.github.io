Hyperledger Fabric REST server built with node and express.

# Scope of Lab
The lab focuses on offline signing scheme as the backend server of Hyperledger Fabric that serves over the fabric-client-flutter's request and sends the request to Hyperledger Fabric network. The implementation of fabric-server-node is based on Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Node.js.
The lab implements [[FABN-895] Fabric SDK client signing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gj5XB7yS-pfjpvZEUQh5lBGSIE6aQemu8A69tAYQtTc/edit#heading=h.blytbnfrd23h) for the server side. It should be used for interacting with Hyperledger Fabric network, handling client requests and sending them to Hyperledger Fabric network, returning the responses to client, and more.
