# Lab Name
[Pluggable Hedera Consensus Service](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/pluggable-hcs)

# Short Description
The Pluggable HCS Lab demonstrates the ability of a Hyperledger Fabric network to connect to the Hedera Consensus Service running on a publicly accessible testnet.

# Scope of Lab
This lab is designed to enable a pluggable consensus option within Hyperledger Fabric. The Hedera Consensus Service is available on the Hedera public network.
The Lab initially uses the Build Your First Network (BYFN) Hyperledger Fabric sample to connect a set of Orderers to the Hedera Consensus Service. The demo shows
the ability of HCS to deliver a set of ordered transactions from the public network to a Fabric network for block creation and propagation.
