# Lab Name
[Cordentity](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/cordentity)

# Short Description
The Cordentity app integrates Indy capabilities into the Corda platform.

While Corda is designed for developing decentralized applications to
manage complex inter-organizational workflows, Indy is the leading
open-source platform for self sovereign identity. This integration
enables the development of decentralized applications on R3's blockchain 
for business while utilizing the self-sovereign identity capabilities 
of Indy.

# Scope of Lab
Cordentity is a self-contained CorDapp that integrates Hyperledger
Indy, for decentralized identity, with the R3 Corda Platform. This
lab creates interoperability of two purpose-built ledger
technologies, each with a focus on privacy. Corda is designed to
enable private transact and Indy is a ledger built specifically for
self-sovereign identity. The integrated platforms extend each
other and allow to build comprehensive end-to-end scenarios.

It is often required to prove identity assertions without necessarily
wanting to reveal the underlying data. For example, an individual may 
need to prove that they are of a certain age without wanting to 
disclose their actual date of birth. Hyperledger Indy uses zero 
knowledge proofs to enable this functionality, allowing someone prove 
a statement is true while preserving confidentiality.
