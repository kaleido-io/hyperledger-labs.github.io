# Lab Name
[Hyperledger Fabric Based Access Control](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/hyperledger-fabric-based-access-control)

# Short Description
A Hyperledger Fabric Based Access Control system to mediate access control flow from centralized applications.

# Scope of Lab
Access control systems exist to protect resources from unauthorized accesses. 
Auditability plays an important role and has its importance increased when it comes to public and private administration, and can be leveraged within a blockchain-based access control system. 
The goal of this project is to develop a Hyperledger Fabric Based Access Control system, to mediate access control requests from a centralized system. 
This mediation aims to discourage unauthorized accesses to confidential information while decentralizing trust when it comes to access control. 
This work will be focused on the implementation of a Proof-Of-Concept and effective techniques to its provisioning and deployment.
