# Lab Name
[Keyhole Fabric API Gateway](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/keyhole-fabric-api-gateway)

# Short Description
Enables client access to Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network through RESTful API's.

# Scope of Lab
Currently client applications can access HLF network Peers using the GoLang, Node, or Java SDK's. This project provides a generalized API gateway that will allow users to query, execute transactions along with querying block storage and configuration using RESTful API's.

This project provides a ready to use solution that developers would otherwise have to implement when trying to provide web clients access to a HLF network.
