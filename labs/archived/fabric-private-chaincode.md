# Lab Name
Hyperledger Fabric Private Chaincode 

# Short Description
This lab enables the execution of chaincodes using Intel SGX for
Hyperledger Fabric.

The transparency and resilience gained from blockchain protocols ensure the
integrity of blockchain applications and yet contradicts the goal to keep
application state confidential and to maintain privacy for its users.

To remedy this problem, this project uses Trusted Execution Environments
(TEEs), in particular Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), to protect the
privacy of chaincode data and computation from potentially untrusted peers.

Intel SGX is the most prominent TEE today and available with commodity CPUs.
It establishes trusted execution contexts called enclaves on a CPU, which
isolate data and programs from the host operating system in hardware and
ensure that outputs are correct.

This lab provides a framework to develop and execute Fabric chaincode
within an enclave.  Furthermore, Fabric extensions for chaincode enclave
registration and transaction verification are provided.

# Scope of Lab
This lab proposes an architecture to enable Private Chaincode
using Intel SGX for Hyperledger Fabric.  We provide an initial
proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed architecture. The main goal of
this lab is to discuss and refine the proposed architecture involving
the Hyperledger community.
