# Lab Name
[Hyperledger Fabric Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operator)

# Short Description
Manage Hyperledger Fabric components at scale with a Kubernetes Operator.

# Scope of Lab
There is a gap in the Hyperledger Fabric network deployment on Kubernetes. The proposal is to automate the deployment using the concept of Kubernetes Operators.

The work will be focused on automating the creation of peers, orderers and CAs.

The proposal is for the deployment of a Hyperledger Fabric network on Kubernetes. This proposal can be integrated natively with the [fabric-operations-console](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/fabric-operations-console) which was recently released.
